This repository is only the Front End, please check the [back repository](https://github.com/AgileTestingColombia/books-back) in order to have all the application

## How To Deploy the application

This applications is thinking to deploy in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and uses the following environment varibles:

| Env Variable     | Description                                                               | Value  |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| BASE_URL         | The backend URL                                                           |        |
| NODE_BUILD_FLAGS | Setting this variable will run ng build <value> in the build step instead | --prod |

**Note 1**: In order to set these environment variables in Heroku check [the documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars)

**Note 2**: Note that these variables are injected at build time if needs to change their values must redeploy the application

## How To Update your fork repository
